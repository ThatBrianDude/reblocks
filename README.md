## API

### ReblocksPayment

To initiate a payment, use the `ReblocksPayment` component.  The `ReblocksPayment` takes in the following props:

- `accountId` {string} account to send funds to
- `amount` {string} ammount of `rai` to send (Note: 1 rai = 1/1,000,000 XRB)
- `onPaymentSuccess` {function} function to run on successful payment.  This is passed { token: 'TOKEN'}

### ReblocksFiatConversion

To display the current value of XRB in a fiat currency, use the `ReblocksFiatConversion` component.  The
`ReblocksFiatConversion` takes in the following props:

- `currency` {currency} 3 digit fiat currency you want to display the current value of 1 XRB

## Contribute

PRs accepted.  Note that this library uses a bunch of linters/code formatters to keep things consistent:

- [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) - TypeScript formatting
- [tslint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) - TypeScript linting
- [markdownlint](https://github.com/mivok/markdownlint) - Markdown linting

To get the project running locally, run `yarn` to install dependencies, and then run:

```typescript
yarn run storybook
```

This will build the project and run [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) on [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006/).
Storybook is also what drives [the demo page](https://goldcaddy77.github.io/reblocks/?selectedKind=ReblocksPayment&selectedStory=Small%20test%20transaction&full=0&addons=1&stories=1&panelRight=1&addonPanel=storybook%2Factions%2Factions-panel).
You can test out your changes by editing the *.story.ts files.  These are what generate the stories on the left navigation.
